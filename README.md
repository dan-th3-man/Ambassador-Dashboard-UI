## What next?
This was just a quick UI mockup to test the concept of an ambassador dashboard, if you would like to see this come to life please let me know at [dan@openformat.tech](mailto:dan@openformat.tech)!

My plan is to build the different components of the dashboard and then allow developers to plug them together to create their own ambassador/rewards dashboards.
